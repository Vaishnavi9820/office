```
employee-management-django/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ empmanagement/           # Main Django project directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accounts/            # User authentication app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ employee/            # Employee management app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ empmanagement/       # Project settings
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ static/              # Static files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/           # HTML templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env                 # Local environment variables
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ manage.py            # Django management script
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile                 # Process file for deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ render.yaml              # Render deployment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Project dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local system

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employee-management-django
   ```

2. Install required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   - The project now uses a `.env` file in the empmanagement directory
   - You can modify the existing one or create your own with the following variables:
     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     DEBUG=True
     ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
     DB_NAME=empdb
     DB_USER=postgres
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password

     DB_PORT=5432
     ```

4. Make migrations and migrate
   ```bash
   cd empmanagement
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the development server
